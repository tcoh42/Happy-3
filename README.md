THE ANSWER IS "DEFINITELY WILL."

HAPPY 3 MONTHS ELLA,

I LOVE YOU SO SO SO MUCH. I PURPOSEFULLY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING IN THE NOTE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SAY IT HERE. 

WE WILL BE CELEBRATING THIS AND MUCH MORE SOON. YOU MEAN THE ENTIRE WORLD TO ME. I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO SEE WHAT I HAVE PLANNED...

ON TO 3 AND THEN 30 YEARS. I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

SEE YOU TONIGHT MY BEAUTIFUL ANGEL.

LOVE,
❤️TC❤️

P.S. SORRY FOR THE SLIGHT REUSE. HAPPY 3 BUT THIS IS #3.5
